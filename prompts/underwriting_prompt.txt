   - Calculate based on provided or estimated Net Operating Income (NOI).
   
2. **Loan Suggestion**:

   - Ensure minimum target ≥ 7% for year one.

4. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Annual Return**:
   - Estimate 5-year IRR and Annualized Return.
   - Target: IRR > 20% and Annual Return > 20% if feasible.
   
5. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Show results if occupancy drops by 5%.
   - Show results if market rents drop by 5%.
